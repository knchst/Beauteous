**Parse**
1. Your Agreement with Parse
1.1 Your use of the Parse service is governed by this agreement (the "Terms"). "Parse" means Parse LLC, located at 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, United States, and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Parse Service. The "Parse Services" means the services Parse makes available through this website, including this website, the Parse cloud computing platform, the Parse API, the Parse Add-ons, and any other software or services offered by Parse in connection to any of those.

1.2 In order to use the Parse Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the Parse Services. You understand and agree that Parse will treat your use of the Parse Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

1.3 You may not use the Parse Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Parse Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Parse Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Parse Services may not be used by children under 13.

1.4 You agree your purchases of Parse Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Parse or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.

2. Your Account and Use of the Parse Services
2.1 You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the Parse Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Parse immediately.

2.2 Your use of the Parse Services must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.

2.3 You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the Parse Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Parse in connection with the Parse Services, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Parse, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Parse Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).

2.4 You may use the Parse Services only to develop and run applications on the Parse infrastructure. You may not access the Parse Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Parse or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Parse Services.

3. Service Policies and Privacy
3.1 You agree to comply with the Parse Acceptable Use Policy available at acceptable use policy (the "Acceptable Use Policy") which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time.

3.2 The Parse Services shall be subject to the privacy policy available at www.parse.com/about/privacy. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Parse's privacy policies.

3.3 You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the End Users of your application. You must obtain any consents required by applicable data protection laws and provide legally adequate privacy notice, access, and protection for End Users. If End Users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the End Users aware that the information will be available to your application and to Parse.

4. Fees for Use of the Parse Services
4.1 Subject to the Terms, the Parse Services are provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources and services can be found at http://parse.com/plans (or such URL as Parse may provide).

4.2 For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in Parse fees and payment policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Parse incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Parse's measurements of your use of the Parse Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Parse and only in the form of credit for the Parse Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates Parse to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Parse may be shared by Parse with companies who work on Parse's behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Parse and servicing your account. Parse may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Parse shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Parse reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Parse Services to you for any late payments.

4.3 Parse may change its fees and payment policies for the Parse Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the website (or such other URL Parse may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.

4.4 You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the Parse Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.

5. Content on the Parse Services and Take Down Obligations
5.1 You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) to which you may have access as part of, or through your use of, the Parse Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the "Content." The term Content shall specifically exclude the web application that you create using the Parse Services and any source code written by you to be used with the Parse Services (collectively, "Applications").

5.2 Parse reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to remove any or all Content from the Parse Services. You agree to immediately take down any Content that violates the Acceptable Use Policy, including pursuant to a take down request from Parse. In the event that you elect not to comply with a request from Parse to take down certain Content, Parse reserves the right to directly take down such Content or to disable Applications.

5.3 In the event that you become aware of any violation of the Acceptable Use Policy by an End User of Applications, you shall immediately terminate such end user's account on your Application. Parse reserves the right to disable Applications in response to a violation or suspected violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.

5.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Parse has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) the Application or any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Parse Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Parse may suffer) by doing so.

5.5 You agree that Parse has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Content and other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Service. You further acknowledge that you are solely responsible for securing and backing up your Applications and any Content.

6. Proprietary Rights
6.1 You acknowledge and agree that Parse (or Parse's licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Parse Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Parse Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).

6.2 Except as provided in Section 8, Parse acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content or Applications that you create, submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Parse Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content and the Application (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Parse, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Parse has no obligation to do so on your behalf.

7. License from Parse and Restrictions
7.1 Parse grants you a revocable, personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Parse as part of the Parse Services as provided to you by Parse. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Parse Services as provided by Parse, in the manner permitted by the Terms.

7.2 You may not (and you may not permit anyone else to): (a) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Parse Services or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Parse, in writing (e.g., through an open source software license); (b) attempt to disable or circumvent any security mechanisms used by the Parse Services or any applications running on the Parse Services; or (c) use the Parse Services in any way that may subject the Parse Services to any obligations under any open source software license, including, without limitation any license which imposes any obligation or restriction with respect to Parse’s patent or other intellectual property rights in the Parse Services.

7.3 Open source software licenses for components of the Parse Services released under an open source license constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the open source software licenses expressly supersede these Terms, the open source licenses govern your agreement with Parse for the use of the components of the Parse Services released under an open source license.

8. License from You
8.1 Parse claims no ownership or control over any Content or Application. You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in the Content and/or Application, and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate. By submitting, posting or displaying the Content on or through the Parse Services you give Parse a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such Content for the sole purpose of enabling Parse to provide you with the Parse Services. Furthermore, by creating an Application through use of the Parse Services, you give Parse a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such Application for the sole purpose of enabling Parse to provide you with the Parse Services.

8.2 By adding a collaborator to your Application, you hereby grant to that user a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable license, with no right to sub-license, to use, display, perform, reproduce, modify, publish, distribute, list information regarding, edit, translate and analyze such Application(s) and Content as permitted by the relevant Parse Services functionality or features for the sole purpose of collaborating on development of the Application(s).

8.3 You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Parse Services, including without limitation about how to improve the Parse Services or our products (“Ideas”). By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place Parse under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.

8.4 You agree that Parse, in its sole discretion, may use your trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features in presentations, marketing materials, customer lists, financial reports and Web site listings (including links to your website) for the purpose of advertising or publicizing your use of the Parse Services.

9. Modification and Termination of the Parse Services
9.1 Parse is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Parse Services which Parse provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you, subject to the terms in Section 4.3.
