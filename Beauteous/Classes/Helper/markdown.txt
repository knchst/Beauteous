### What's Markdown

Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to valid HTML

### Basic writing

**Paragraphs**

Paragraphs in Markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.

**Headings**

You can create a heading by adding one or more # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.
